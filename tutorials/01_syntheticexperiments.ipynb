    "This notebook introduces the concept of synthetic experiments and demonstrates how to implement one using Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "Synthetic experiments are a powerful tool for studying the relationship between independent variables (factors) and dependent variables (observations) in a controlled environment. They allow us to collect synthetic data that resembles real empirical data but is not as complex, only as noisy as we want it to be, and is also free from real-world limitations such as financial and time restrictions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Synthetic experiments are run with simulation models instead of real physical/biological systems. In cognitive science this means to replace the participant with a cognitive model yielding similar (but probably simpler) behavior. A cognitive model can be constituted already from a single mathematical expression making it easier to evaluate our experimental designs and adaptive algorithms. \n",
    "\n",
    "This way, the later introduced concepts and algorithms from the 'Optimizing Experimental Design' course can be implemented, tested and validated easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will learn how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Implement a cognitive model that represents the relationship between the independent and dependent variables.\n",
    "- Generate more realistic data by adding noise to the synthetic observations.\n",
    "- Define experimental units, factors, and levels which will serve as the base of the synthetic experiment.\n",
    "- Generate a dataset by defining a sample size, different treatments and eventually collecting samples from the experimental unit.\n",
    "- Fit a model to the collected data and recover the parameters of the ground truth function.\n",
    "- Get a feeling for the recovered model quality in dependence of the sample size and data quality (noise level)\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this tutorial, you will have a good understanding of how to implement and analyze synthetic experiments using Python."

    "We want to examine the response times of participants in a two-alternative-forced-choice (2AFC) experiment. This experiment consists of an image which is shown for a short period of time. The image is a grid of either orange or blue tiles as shown in the picture below. \n",

    "We can control the experiment via the two factors **ratio** and **scatterdness**. \n",
