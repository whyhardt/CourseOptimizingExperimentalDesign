    "One of the most well-known experiments to test the Stroop effect is to show a participant a series of words for colors that are also displayed in color. Sometimes, the color of the word is the same as the color in which the word is written — this is called congruence. Other times, the word and color are different, which is incongruence.\n",

    "There is also a third factor: whether the pairing of the color and text is congruent or incongruent. This is a form of derived factor, and we’ll come back to it later.\n",
    "\n",
    "To test this effect, we can construct a series of trials to administer to a participant, where each trial is a single color+text pairing. For this experiment, we will use the three colors red, green, and blue, and we will also use the names of those colors as the text. All together, this gives us 9 possible values for each trial:\n",
